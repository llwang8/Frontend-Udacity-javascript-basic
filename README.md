## Udacity Data Analyst and Frontend Nanodegrees

# JavaScript Basic

In this course, I explore the JavaScript programming language by creating an interactive version of my résumé. I learn the JavaScript programming fundamentals I need while building new elements and sections to enhance my résumé.


## Project - Interactive Resume

I develop an interactive resume application while taking Udacity course - JavaScript Basic. This application reads my resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. I use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that display on the resume. [Check it out!](http://llwang8/github.io/Udacity-frontend-p2-interactiveResume/)
