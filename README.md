# Interactive Resume

I develop an interactive resume application while taking Udacity course - JavaScript Basic. This application reads my resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. I use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that display on the resume. [Check it out!](http://llwang8/github.io/Udacity-frontend-p2-interactiveResume/)
