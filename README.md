## Udacity Data Analyst and Frontend Nanodegrees

# JavaScript Basic

This course makes introduction to the world of data analysis. I learned how to go through the entire data analysis process, which includes:

Posing a question
Wrangling your data into a format you can use and fixing any problems with it
Exploring the data, finding patterns in it, and building your intuition about it
Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
Communicating your findings

I also learn how to use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.


## Project - Interactive Resume

I develop an interactive resume application while taking Udacity course - JavaScript Basic. This application reads my resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. I use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that display on the resume. [Check it out!](http://llwang8/github.io/Udacity-frontend-p2-interactiveResume/)
